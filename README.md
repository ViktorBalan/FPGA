# FPGA

This is a directory documenting a school project. The first objective is to familiarize oneself with verilog and the FPGA, and the ultimate goal is to build a simple CPU program on the [Icestick](https://www.latticesemi.com/icestick).
The tutorials and resources used for the leaning stage are stored in the `learning` directory.
