# Learning resources

I mostly used tutorials made by DigiKey available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLg1AgA2Xoo&list=PLEBQazB0HUyT1WmMONxRZn9NmQ_9CIKhb) on Youtube.
I have used [Apio](https://github.com/FPGAwars/apio) to build and test the programs, and run them on the [Icestick](https://www.latticesemi.com/icestick) itself.
The folders here document programs I have created, mostly following the exercise statements in the tutorial:

1. gate
	a simple exercise solution using wire assignment - an adder circuit that adds three bit inputs together and displays the result on two output bits
	
2. counter
	an always loop test - a circuit with two inputs and four LEDs that counts through numbers 0-15 in a loop with every "clock" tick
	
3. msm
	a Moore State Machine


The source codes of exercises in the folders can be built, uploaded onto the Icestick and then run by following these instructions:
